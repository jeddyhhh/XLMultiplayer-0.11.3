# XLMultiplayer
Skater XL Multiplayer mod by silentbaws has reached end of life. With the release of official multiplayer there's no longer a space for the mod and will shutdown at the end of May 2021

Official multiplayer went down for several days, so there is a space for this mod, modified to accept a custom IP for a new master server found here: https://github.com/jeddyhhh/New-Silents-Mod-Master-Server/tree/main

For SXL 1.1.0.4 only, porting this to 1.2.2.8 might be a challenge, I can see some pretty drastic differences between the 2 versions.
